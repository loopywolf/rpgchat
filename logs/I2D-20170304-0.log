Loopy|Man, this is too easy
Loopy|Yay!
Loopy|I'm back!
Loopy|I'm doing tests n the software
Loopy|man this is just too easy
Loopy| rolled 19% of 6+3(9) vs PER(9) and got -6
Sholin|test
Loopy|hey Sholin
Sholin|heeyaaa
Loopy|So, some pieces are already working, some yet to come
Sholin|which pieces are functioning, and which arn't?
Loopy|You can see your sheet, you can see the logs, and you can change your character 
Loopy|name/game
Loopy|You can chat here, with colors - you can change to other scenes with those butto
Loopy|ns - the scenes light up if there are changes
Loopy|the rolling works
Loopy| rolled 02% of PER+6(15) vs 7+2(9) and got -9
Sholin|nice
Loopy|still to be done "game info" the map, pinterest, help
Loopy|+1xp type stuff
Sholin| rolled 88% of STR(7) vs 6 and got 5
Loopy|it's going quickly however
Loopy|what was that?
Sholin|was testing a roll
Loopy| you know what you typed?
Sholin| rolled 88% of STR(7) vs 6 and got 5
Loopy|what did you type that wasn't working?
Sholin|nothing
Sholin|i'm not typing anything
Loopy|i wonder what that null-null is
Loopy|it's a bug whatever it is
Sholin|yes it is
Sholin|a weird one at that
Sholin|ks
Sholin|sheet button works
Loopy|logs should work too
Loopy|and change
Loopy|and scene changers
Loopy|those all work
Loopy|plus the chat and rolls
Sholin|whatever is causing the null, is cutting whatever i'm typing out
Sholin|hm
Sholin|theres no scroll bar in the chat
Sholin|so all it does it just push it down
Loopy|emove older messages
Loopy|good point, needs to do that
Loopy|i am unsure what the null-null is
Loopy|will have to dig into that
Loopy| it also has a tendency to clear my text if I leave it
Loopy|after a period of time right?
Loopy|also it seems to have a limnit of how much I can type in.. after that it doesn't
Loopy|yeah that's weird
Loopy|I can easily add a check to not display something null:null but I'm more curious
Loopy|where it's coming from
Loopy|well that's one good thing - it doesn't go into the log
Loopy|Re-load the page
Loopy|The message length bug should be gone now.. You should be able to type an arbitrarily long message,.. i.e as long as you want.. At least, if it doesn't reset it...
Loopy|cool - what is "Edge?"
Loopy|ohhh
Loopy|ah no I didn't implement the whisper yet!
Loopy|yes, there should be a list of players
Loopy|hm wonder how I should do that?
Loopy|AHA is that why
Loopy|thanks.. that will help me fix it
Loopy|sucks
Loopy|i hope so
Loopy|thanks
Loopy|it's coming along nicely.. and it's pretty easy to do too
Loopy|this bug you found - I didn't even know because I can't do two things at once
Loopy|oh yeah, good point
Loopy|well its' not in question -0 it's a bug and has to be fixed
