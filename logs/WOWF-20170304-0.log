Tunlok|and tested name change
Tunlok|map seems... partly working atm
Tunlok|that null is making things difficult
Tunlok|nice
Tunlok|it does show what I said when scene changes happen
Tunlok|yeah
Tunlok|it'll clear any text left in the messag ebox
Tunlok|right
Tunlok|well at least it tells you someone disconnects
Tunlok|test
Tunlok|transfered over from Edge to firefox
Tunlok|Microsoft Edge
Tunlok|basically their 'replacement' for Internet Explorer
Tunlok|its all looking good so far Loopy
Tunlok|are there ways to message people privately?
Tunlok|well glad I brought it up
Tunlok|and we definatly should have a list of who is in the rooms too
Tunlok|definitely*
Tunlok|mmmmm
Tunlok|now theres a problem
Tunlok|seems the chat will get cut whenever someone posts
Tunlok|I could be typing and the moment you say something its gone
Tunlok|thats why each time the null was going off, it would cut what I said
Tunlok|at least it means you can fix it
Tunlok|still, this is very good
Tunlok|yeah, hopefully once its all ready, we can really put it to the test
Tunlok|heh, ok, just type something and leave it there for a second
Tunlok|right, it would be gone
Tunlok|faster typers would be pretty much dominating it all.
Tunlok|and it would fustrate everyone else
Tunlok|right
Tunlok|true that if we're taking turns it won't matter much
Tunlok|but we're not always constrained to turn order
Tunlok|sensitive little thing...
